            <h2>The String Data Type</h2>
The string data type is used to represent textual data 
(i.e. sequences of characters). Strings are created using single or 
double quotes surrounding one or more characters
        </p>
        <p>
            <h2>The Number Data Type</h2>
The number data type is used to represent positive or negative numbers 
with or without decimal place, or numbers written using exponential 
notation e.g. 1.5e-4 (equivalent to 1.5x10-4).
        </p>
            <h2>The Boolean Data Type</h2>
The Boolean data type can hold only two values: true or false. 
It is typically used to store values like yes (true) or no (false), 
on (true) or off (false), etc. Boolean values also come as a 
result of comparisons in a program.
        <p>
            <h2>The Null Data Type</h2>
This is another special data type that can have only one value-the null 
value. A null value means that there is no value. It is not equivalent 
to an empty string ("") or 0, it is simply nothing.A variable can be 
explicitly emptied of its current contents by assigning it the null value.
        </p>
        <p>
            <h2>The Object Data Type</h2>
The object is a complex data type that allows you to store collections of 
data.An object contains properties, defined as a key-value pair. 
A property key (name) is always a string, but the value can be any data 
type, like strings, numbers, booleans, or complex data types like arrays, 
function and other objects.
        <p>
            <h2>The Array Data Type</h2>
An array is a type of object used for storing multiple values in single 
variable. Each value (also called an element) in an array has a numeric 
position, known as its index, and it may contain data of any data 
type-numbers, strings, booleans, functions, objects, and even other 
arrays. The array index starts from 0, so that the first array element 
is arr[0] not arr[1].
        </p>
        <h2>The Function Data Type</h2>
The function is callable object that executes a block of code. 
Since functions are objects, so it is possible to assign them to 
variables.Functions can be stored in variables, objects, and 
arrays. Functions can be passed as arguments to other functions, 
and functions can be returned from functions.
        <p>
            <h2>The Undefined Data Type</h2>
The undefined data type can only have one value-the special value 
undefined. If a variable has been declared, but has not been assigned 
a value, has the value undefined.
