         var declarations are globally scoped or function/locally scoped.
         The scope is global when a var variable is declared outside a
         function. This means that any variable that is declared with var 
         outside a function block is available for use in the whole window.
         var is function scoped when it is declared within a function. 
         This means that it is available and can be accessed only within 
         that function.*/
